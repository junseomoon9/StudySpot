# StudySpot

[StudySpot](https://stoic-euler-abc0a4.netlify.app/) is a web application designed for UofT students to easily find new study partners around the campus.

Built with React, MongoDB, Express, Node JS, Leaflet JS.

# How It Works

- Users can create a "StudySpot" which contains information about the location the user is studying at, what course the user is studying and how many seats are available for other people to join you to study together.
- After creating a "StudySpot", a marker will populate on a map corresponding to the location of your "StudySpot" which will include the other information the user has typed in.
- If a person wants to study with another group or person, they can look at the list of "StudySpots" on the map and can decide if they would like to go there and meet with the person who created the "StudySpot".
